# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
# Python is the most popular programming language, it is rated the most used by Popularity of Programming language (index) index
"""
Python is an object-oriented scripting language that was released publicly in 1991. It was
developed by Guido van Rossum of the National Research Institute for Mathematics and
Computer Science in Amsterdam.
Python has rapidly become one of the world’s most popular programming languages.
It’s now particularly popular for educational and scientific computing, and it recently
surpassed the programming language R as the most popular data-science programming
language. Here are some reasons why Python is popular and everyone should consider
learning it:
• It’s open source, free and widely available with a massive open-source community.
• It’s easier to learn than languages like C, C++, C# and Java, enabling novices and
professional developers to get up to speed quickly.

# comments

# python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation
# comments start with a hash, and python will render the rest of the line as a comment

# print("Hello World")

# why do we comment
# comments are used to explain python code or for documentation
# e.g
# this is to print a message on the screen
# print("Welcome to python class. it promises to be exciting.") # this is to print a message on the screen
# this is to print a message on the screan

# comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code

# Variables Declaration
# variables are containers for storing data value, a variable is created the moment you assign a value to it

# myName = "Maranatha"
# variableName = "This can be anything"

# print(myName)
# print(variableName)

std_name = "TIMI"
location = "Ogbomoso"
state = "Oyo"

# print('my name is TIMI and i am from Ogbomoso in oyo State')
# print("my name is " + std_name + " and I am from " + location + " in " + state + " state")
# print(f"my name is {std_name} and I am from {location} in {state} state")

# print("my name is " + std_name + " and i am from" + location + "in " + state + "state") #"+" this means "concatenation sign", it is used to joined strings together
# print(f"My name is {std_name} and i am from {location} in {state} state") #"f" is used as formated string, it is always needed in the case of formating of strings.

# location = "Ibadan"
# state = "Lagos"
# print(f"I am {std_name} and i am located in {location} in {state} state")

# Variable name
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

# name = "ade"
# _name = "ade"
# print(Name)
# Name = "bayo"
# print(_name)
# x = 'ADE'
# print(x)
# _x = "tunde"
# print(_x)

# A variable name cannot start with a number

# 12_student = "ade"
# print(12_student)

# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
# ade_123 = "Male"
# tunde123 = "MALE"
# print(tunde123)
# print(ade_123)

# variable names are case-sensitive
#  tolu, Tolu, TOLU
# name = "ade"
# print(name)
student = "tolu"
# print(Student)
# tolu = 10
# print(tolu)

# python keywords cannot be used as a variable name
# is = "Jss1"
# print(is)

# Multi words variable names
# Camel case
# e.g
# mySecondName = "Shola"

# myFirstName = "something"


# js1StudentName = "Bayo"


# print(studentName)
# snake case - each words separated by an underscore
# # e.g
# student_name_one = "Ade"
# print(student_name_one)

# ways of declaring a variable
fname = "ade"
lname = "Toba"
location = "ogbomosho"
state = "Oyo"

# Assigning Multiple values

# fName, lName, location, state = "Yemi", "Sunday", "Ogbomoso", "Oyo state"
# print(fName)
# print(location)
# total = [fName, lName, location, state]
# print(total)
# print(fName)
# print(location)
# print(state)

# one value to multiple variable
# x = "pawpaw"
# y = "pawpaw"

# Assignment
# Write a program that will ask a user the following information;

# DATA TYPE
# Datatypes
# Datatypes are the classification or categorization of data items.
# It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data
# since everything is an object in python, data types are actually classes and variables are instance
# (object) of these classes.

# name = "tola"

# Types of Datatype
# 1. Text types: String (str) a string is collection of one or more characters put in a quote
# 2. Numeric types- represent the data which has numeric value: integer(int), float, complex
# 3. Sequence types - ordered collection of different data types. it allows multipe values to be stored: list, tuple, range
# 4. Mapping types: dictionary(dict)
# 5. Set types - is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate element: set, frozenset
# 6. Boolean types - data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False: bool (True, False)
# 7. Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

# Examples
# string (str)  #example: "Johnson", "False", "56", 'b' '5.9', "this is my first python class"
# integer (int) example: 65, 80, 1, 254854
# float (float) example: 7.8, 5.5, 0.3
# complex example: 10j


# list example:
# mm =  list((1,  3, 4, "one", "two", True, False, 10j, 10.1))
# mm =  [1,  3, 4, "one", "two", True, False, 10j, 10.1]
# print(type(mm))
# numbering = """
# 1. Faith 
# 2. Sola
# 3. Ola
# """

# print(type(numbering))

# tuple example: (5, 55, 7), tuple((5, 55, 7)) title()
# range example: range(10)

# dictionary example: {"school":"SQI", "course":"Python"}, dict((name="Ola", age=22))
# stds = {"Ade":"Ajayi"}
# print(type(stds))
# x = 5.0
# print(type(x))

# student = "name"

# mm = ({1,2,3,4,5,6})
# print(type(mm))
# frozenset example: ({1,2,3,4,5,6})

# operators
# they are special symbols that designate the sort of computation to be performed.
# Types of Operator
# 1. Arithmetic operators - operators that performs mathematic operation: +, -, /, *, %, //, **

# print(9 // 2)

# 2. Assignment operators- assigns values to the operands on the left hand side: =, +=, -=, /=, *=, //=, %=, **=,  etc

# val = 30
# print(val + 5)
# val += 5
# print(val)
# val -= 5
# val /= 5

# user_score = 40
# print(user_score)
# exam_score = int(input("Enter your exam score "))
# user_score += exam_score
# print(user_score)

# newval = 40
# newval //= 10
# print(newval)

# 3. Comparison operators- to compare numbers or strings and returns boolean ==, !=, >, <, <=, >=,

# val = 9
# val2 = 8
# print(val == val2)
# print(val <= val2)
# print(val != val2)


# 4. Logical operators - to combine conditional statement : and, or, not
# 5. Identity operators: to compare objects, not if they are equal but if they are actually the same object: is, is not

val1 = 20
val3 = 40
# print(val1 is val3)

# 6. Membership Operators - to test if a sequence is present in an object: in, not in

# arr1 = ["Ade", "Bola", 20, 30]
# print("ade" in arr1)

# 7. Bitwise operators - used to perform bitwise operations on bit patterns or binary numerals: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# x = 20
# x + 5
# x += 5
# print(x)
# x += 5
# print(x)
